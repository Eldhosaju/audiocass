Baby cry audio classification model

# Introduction


I have created an audio classification API for classifying baby cry and Web App.What this app do is that,I have created a model trained with baby cry audio files attached with the reason for crying.The webapp is capable of classifing audio files based on this model.

Well if you want to make your code available to the world you need to make it accessible from the web. There are 2 main ways you can do this:

1. Create an API, which allows any other application (whether it's an iOS, Android or within any other software) to access it via the API protocol. APIs are Application Programming Interfaces that facilitate access to complex external applications via a simplified interface. 

2. Create a Web App, this is basically the same as an API, except we'll be allowing users to access or run our app via any web browser.

This is an ongoing project and is not completed fully.Right now the accuracy is limited to just 40% and that is mainly due to the lack of available data for training.And so i am working on ways to improve efficiency with limited datasets.
